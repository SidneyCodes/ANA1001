# ANA1001

Welcome to my repository for ANA1001, Programming for Analytics, or as I refer to it, Python 101.

This course is a lot of fun, and covers everything from Python variables, functions, classes, OOP, and of course a healthy mix of dinosaurs chasing chickens. Some of the projects involve flask, django, and many other packages.

I hope you find these example projects interesting!
