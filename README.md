# ANA1001

Welcome to my repository for ANA1001, Programming for Analytics, or as I refer to it, Python 101.

This course is a lot of fun, and covers everything from variables, functions, classes, OOP, and of course a healthy mix of dinosaurs chasing chickens.

I hope you find these example projects interesting!
